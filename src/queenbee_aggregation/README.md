# Team 2 - Winning Solution

## Algorithm Overview
1. Assign 1 robot as Queenbee (in the absence of external IR controller)
2. Form seed spinning group once Queenbee collides with another robot
3. Other robots eventually identifies spinning cluster via checking avg. IR recipts against pre-identified threshold
